# K2 Taxonomy System

K2 is the premier CCK for Joomla, being easy to use and to template. Its flexibility is one of its more attractive features, however, this flexibility does not extend to content types, or a Taxonomic system. For K2 to reach the next level, be enterprise-ready, and suitable for large-scale projects, it needs to be true taxonomic.

Converting K2 to a true taxonomic system may seem to be an unsourmontable task, but with careful planning and clever project design, I believe it can be achieved with non-major interventions to its code, and still maintain backwards compatibility with most plugins and modules.

This project was initially concocted in Adobe XD, and the published prototype link will be provided below. Comments are welcome, and should be opened as issues under this repository. The next phase will be to convert this into an HTML5 prototype, where contributors can add their ideas or fork into a similar proposal.

**Important note:** this work is being created with the intention of inclusion into K2. No permission is granted to turn it, either as a whole or just parts of it, into a free or commercially developed extension, module, plugin or something else, not for Joomla or any other CMS. After the work is completed, license might be granted on a case by case basis, after careful analysis.
